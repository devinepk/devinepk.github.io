    <h1>Possiblities.</h1>

      <p>That's what I think about when coding comes to mind - and that's also why I'm currently enrolled in Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp.
      </p><br>
      <p>But back to <b>possiblities</b>. To code is to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Solve problems with technology <i>for me, that's real estate</i>.</li>
        <li>Create a legacy for your family <i>which means my wife and four kids</i>.</li>
        <li>And to be part of something bigger than myself <i>I don't think the internet and computers are going anywhere</i>.</li>
      </ul>


      <h1>Ideas.</h1>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enabling home buyers and home sellers to conduct the search, negotiation, and transaction from their phone.</li>
          <li><i>I'll add more as they come - 9/18/18.</i></li>
